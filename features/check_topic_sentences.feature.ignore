Feature: Checking topic sentences
    As a writer
    So that I can make sure my topic sentences make sense
    I want to look at just the first sentences of each paragraph

    Scenario: Checking topic sentences for some paragraphs
        Given I am on the "topic-sentences" page
        And I send "t" as "Many students entering college have experience interacting with one another online through email, instant messaging, discussion boards, social networks, and other digital technologies (Jenkins, 2009). As these tools become central to professional industries and to having a voice in a networked public sphere (Benkler, 2006), students in learning institutions have an opportunity to practice these digital skills in educational environments through course management systems (CMSs), wikis, real-time collaboration environments, and web-based learning tools. \r\nHowever, retrofitting campus technologies in ways that do not preserve the flexibility, usability and functionality that students have come to expect from their prior experiences online may serve to reinforce their perception of formal learning environments as separate and distinct from the 'real world.' In other words, students' experience of media, information and knowledge through networked technologies may appear incongruent to the ways that formal education is delivered to them in the academy (Zhang, 2009). Thus, as innovation in educational technology progresses, it is increasingly important to examine how students engage in networked environments outside of educational interventions to understand and incorporate the students' expected norms and prior knowledge into these systems.        Theoretical perspectives of Web culture attribute much of the innovation happening on the Web with the breakdown of “transaction costs,” or any barrier to production in the form of monetary expense or human resources (Benkler, 2006; Shirky, 2008). In other words, Web culture in the form of blogging, social networking, and the general amateurization of cultural production has emerged because it is “easy” to share and produce content. When educational technology interventions misunderstand or do not uphold these expectations upon which Web tools have emerged, these transaction costs are rebuilt and the tools become inefficient for the users. A more complete picture of emergent online participation, then, is a crucial part of designing educational technologies and initiatives.         \r\nResearchers must not, however, overstate the assumption that all 'millennials' are equally proficient computer users. Research has shown that there is wide range of technology skills and abilities among students who have grown up with computers in their household based on race, class or other social distinctions (Jackson et al., 2008; Rainie, 2003). For these students, educational institutions become settings in which students develop the expertise to communicate and collaborate with digital technologies. Yet students participating in academic endeavors with inauthentic technologies may not receive adequate media literacy skills to be competitive in a modern workforce or to have a voice in a networked information economy. Thus, educational technologies should provide students a continuity of function between formal and informal environments to both increase the efficacy of learning tools and to bring authentic media literacy skills into learning contexts." to "topic-sentences"
        Then I should see list item "Many students entering college have experience interacting with one another online through email, instant messaging, discussion boards, social networks, and other digital technologies (Jenkins, 2009). "
        And I should see list item "However, retrofitting campus technologies in ways that do not preserve the flexibility, usability and functionality that students have come to expect from their prior experiences online may serve to reinforce their perception of formal learning environments as separate and distinct from the &#x27;real world."
        And I should see list item "Researchers must not, however, overstate the assumption that all &#x27;millennials&#x27; are equally proficient computer users. "
        And I should see "Does this match your outline? "
